ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GottusJ. I am a Python enthusiast who is currently diving into the world of SQL. I have a passion for programming and love exploring new technologies. Python has been my language of choice, and I enjoy creating applications and solving problems with it. Lately, I've been eager to expand my skills and knowledge in database management, which is why I'm currently focusing on learning SQL.
